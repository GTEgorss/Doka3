# Doka3
Two balls, you and lots of fun on your computer:)
![iHaveAnIdea](https://github.com/GTEgorss/Doka3/blob/master/src/media/opening.jpg)

  This is a logical arcade game with minimalistic graphics. In this game, the playerâ€™s task is to make two balls, blue and red, touch each other. To do this, they can draw on the screen all sorts of figures that will help them. Balls obey the laws of physics. And passing a level does not depend on specific circumstances - you decide which way to draw and how to complete it.
In a word - a smart puzzle that will give pleasure by its physics, simplicity and will make you to spend several nights playing it.

# Time to start
After lauching **Doka3** all in your hands:)
<p>It's time to create!!!</p>

### Rules
1. Your main goal is to get two balls touched by each other
2. You can reach your goal anyway you like, drawing anything with your pen, but don't let the balls get off the screen)
3. After you stop drawing the first curve, physics become active: everything which should fall is falling, everything which should move is moving. You can draw more curves, but only during the movement with physics on
4. Each level has its own idea and its own system of obstacles and other things, which distance you from you goal

### Opportunities 
 1. In **Doka3** your able to choose out of *three pens*, which are all available from the very beginning of the game. You can find them in *pens menu*
 2. You can easily *redo* any levels you want out of you have already passed, you should just enter the *levels menu*
 3. If you decide to restart the game progress, you can delete the current in the settings
